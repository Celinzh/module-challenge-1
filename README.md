# Wealthfront
 
## Overview and Origin
Wealthfront was founded by Benchmark co-founder Andy Rachleff and Dan Carroll in 2008 as a mutual fund analysis company called ""kaChing"" (Kerr, 2016). In 2009, Its CEO Andy Rachleff stated in the New York Times profile, "The mutual fund industry is a $10 trillion industry that has seen no innovation for 25 years. The Internet has had no impact." (Kerr, 2016). In October 2010, after the company achieved $100 million in accumulated assets under management, it officially changed its name to "Wealthfront" (Li, et al., 2017). In December 2011, its new fintech product, an algorithm-powered wealth management advisor, came out with no charges for accounts up to $25,000 and merely 0.25 per cent on assets (Li, et al., 2017). 
 
Wealthfront has raised $204.5 million in funding over six rounds from 2008 to 2018 (Crunchbase, 2022). It is funded by 38 investors, including the most recent ones, such as Dag Ventures and Spark Capital (Crunchbase, 2022).
 
## Business Activities
###Company Objective
The original focus of Wealthfront was to provide financial consulting services to the technology companies. After realising the potential for technology innovation in the wealth management industry, Wealthfront shifted its objective to utilise computer software to give investment advice to a broader community at a lower cost (Andrew & Mitchell, 2019). As Wealthfront (2018) stated: "Our mission here is to democratise access to sophisticated financial advice for everyone."
 
###Market Overview
According to the ReseachDive report (2022), the global advisory market is expected to grow revenues to $59,344.5 million by 2028, increasing at a CAGR of 39.9% from 2021 to 2028. 
The segment of the market (Yahoo Finance, 2022)
- The hybrid Robo-advisory sub-segment is predicted to be the ideal alternative for Robo advisory-based investment services. It is estimated to have a revenue of $31,413.0 million by 2028.
- The Asia-Pacific region is identified as the fastest-growing market, estimated to hit a revenue of $19,518.4 million by 2028. The region has the largest growing middle-class population and high-net-worth entrepreneurs.
 
###Features
Wealthfront is recognised as the best Robo-advisor platform for goal planning features among other competitors (Friedberg, 2022). Its goal planning and financial decision-making tools, collectively called Path, are the best among the Robo-advisor platform reviews (Friedberg, 2022).
Investors who use Wealthfront can choose from the following initial goals (Investopedia, 2022):
Retirement
Buying a home
Saving for future education
Taking time off from work
Making a large purchase
Investing a windfall
Path will automatically project client’s likelihood of reaching the stated goals while considering the relative factors such as inflation, income changes, market performance, etc. (Friedberg, 2022). There will also be a digital display to track progress towards clients' financial goals. In addition to the progress tracking, Path will also be able to draw out charts and graphs to inform clients of the cost of the goals (Friedberg, 2022). Path is capable of answering more than 10,000 financial planning questions (Friedberg, 2022). This automatic financial analysis tool will be free to access no matter whether the client will use Wealthfront to invest or not. Other than that, Wealthfront has customised portfolios with ETFs and cryptocurrency funds, direct stock indexing for larger accounts which is 100,000 minimum, as well as daily tax-loss harvesting (Friedberg, 2022).
 
###Technology for robo-advisor
Comprehensive Robo-advisors use artificial intelligence (AI) to gather additional data - they analyse the investor's real financial behaviour by looking at their investment, bank, and credit card activities.
 
## Landscape
###Robo-advisory domain
A major shift toward automation has been largely witnessed in different industries over the last decade (Machet, 2021). The technical revolution has spread to the financial industry known as Robo-advisors (Machet, 2021). The market is predicted to expand prosperously. In Australia alone, it is estimated that investment managed by Robo-advisors will increase from US$5.6 billion in 2021 to $21.2 billion by 2025 (Machet, 2021).
 
###Major innovation of the domain
Robo-advisors are software designed to do what human investment brokers normally do with algorithms (Antretter et al., 2020). With the help of this fintech product, millions of data points will be analysed to spread clients' money across the most suitable investments, as well as necessary adjustments will be made to maintain an optimal portfolio for their financial goals (Antretter, 2020).
 
###History
The automated trading algorithm has been on the market since the early 2000s (Machet, 2021). However, it wasn't accessible to average investors and was very expensive. Until the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 shook the public trust in the major bankruptcy financial institutions like Lehman Brothers, the start-ups leveraging the emerging technologies as an alternative started to have a competitive edge (Machet, 2021). In the present era, Robo-advisors are offered by various applications and platforms. It has been innovated to use machine learning to detect patterns in data and achieve an optimal portfolio for an investor (Machet, 2021).
 
###Advantages
Robo-advisor services are cheaper and require lower opening balances. It is also more accessible for everyone with an internet connection. Most importantly, Robo-advisor technology performs better than human advisors since they are faster, non-stop, and more rational than humans (Antretter et al., 2020). A study by Harvard (2016) found that investments made by Robo-advisors significantly outperformed the average novice and experienced investors.
 
###Major competitors
According to Investopedia, different Robo-advisors companies have outstanding features in different areas.
Best Overall: Wealthfront 
Best for Beginners: Betterment 
Best for Low Costs: M1 Finance
Best for Mobile: E*TRADE Core Portfolios
Best for Goal Planning: Wealthfront
Best for Portfolio Construction: Interactive Advisors
Best for Portfolio Management: Personal Capital
Best for Cash Management: Betterment 
Best for Education: Merrill Guided Investing 
Best for Socially Responsible Investing: Interactive Advisors 
Best for Sophisticated Investors: M1 Finance
 
The Robo-advisor domain has become competitive in the present era, running down the fees and business models. A study founded by BlackRock (2016) noted there were 22 new Robo-advisory firms launched in the US in 2014 and 44 in 2015 (Andrew & Mitchell, 2019). Wealthfront'sWealthfront's biggest competitors include Betterment, WiseBanyan, FutureAdvisor, etc. To attract smaller investors, Wealthfront dropped its minimum account value from $5,000 to $5,00 in 2015 competing with Betterment'sBetterment's business model that charges $3 per month for accounts value less than $100 per month. Moreover, traditional players are adapting to the new technology and entering the market. Charles Schwab and Vanguard have introduced their own Robo-advisor platforms with similar fees. In the meantime, services that combine automated and human features challenge pure Robo platforms like Wealthfront. In August 2015, the world's largest asset management firm Blackrock acquired fintech company FutureAdvisor, provoking more competition in the market. 
Wealthfront and other competitive companies have demonstrated the massive value and competition in the automated investment market at the same time. 
 
 
## Results
 
###Business impact
Before 2008, Traditional banks usually provided their financial analysis services to high-net-worth individuals with wealthy backgrounds and sizable assets. However, Wealthfront can offer investment services for lower-income people (Li, et al., 2017). On top of that, Wealthfront only charges customers assets fees, without any commission fees. The low and transparent pricing enables Wealthfront to compete directly with the traditional banking industry (Li, et al., 2017).
 
###Performance assessment (Investopedia, 2022)
There are a series of metrics to measure the performance of a Robo-advisor company more than investment returns. Moreover, a company with good historical returns doesn't necessarily guarantee that it will consistently outperform its previous outcome. Safety and growth potential are also important.
Account minimum
A minimum account requirement is necessary to measure a Robo-advisor company's accessibility and convenience. Wealthfront has a $500 compulsory deposit while Betterment, Ellevest, and Wealthsimple all have $0 account minimums. Services like Schwab Intelligent Portfolios Premium and Vanguard Personal Advisor Services require a minimum deposit of $25,000 and $50,000, respectively.
Availability of human advisors
Robo-advisor companies also vary in how many human advisors investors can access. A good mixture of automation and human advisors is predicted to be the best business model for users. Wealthfront doesn't have live advisor services. However, it has a free financial planning tool (Path).
Fees
Management and investment fees are essential from a long-term financial perspective. The expense ratios of Wealthfront are between 0.08% and 0.11%, whilst that of Betterment range from 0.07% to 0.17%.
Annualised return
Long-term returns are another metric to measure investment performance. Five years or longer returns are more beneficial to have a look on. Wealthfront has a 2.77% 2.5-year annualised return, compared to Betterment and Vanguard, with returns of 1.80% and 3.42% perspectively. 
 
 
## Recommendations
I would suggest Wealthfront embed a customised virtual assistant for every client as a financial butler similar to Siri. The users would customise the virtual assistant, including what sectors would the AI be responsible for managing and what sector of information should the virtual assistant keep an eye on in the market. As estimated by the study funded by Harvard (2017), a combined human and automated advisor would be ideal for the Robo-advisor company to operate. Because Wealthfront doesn't have human-advisor services, it could be quite lost when the clients don't have a strong financial literacy. This customised virtual assistant will not only provide beginner investors with basic financial knowledge, but it will also have the function of monitoring the industry or market that sophisticated investors are interested in. To be more specific, the virtual assistant could monitor Elon Musk'sMusk's Twitter if the investors are interested in space or high-tech stocks, and it will automatically update the users on the newest information. It could also customise a financial report for the users' information and interests collected from the internet regularly.
This feature focuses on filling the gap of Wealthfront'sWealthfront's lack of human advisors and increasing its user experience. This feature could create a unique investing experience while most of the data or market analysis work is complicated and sometimes tedious. This AI could be like a friend to inspire investors, especially beginner inventors and an assistant to scrape useful information for sophisticated investors. This technology would include Voice Recognition integrated with machine learning.
 
The future of Robo-advisory companies by looking to expand their services and equip themselves with a competitive edge includes providing enhanced customer experience, personalisation, and better advisory outcomes  (Wipro, 2020).
